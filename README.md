AutoIT Script for Saving "unprintable" Cengage eTextbooks into image files

This is an old script I had written after purchasing a Cengage eTextbook for $80+, available in digital format only, that only let me "print" a limited number of pages per day. The textbook allowed saving individual pages, but you could not batch them together past X pages each 24 hour period. 

I am not aware, as of 2022, if Cengage still uses this system but this script should be generic enough to give you a starting point for any eTextbook that places similar artifically limits on your purchase.

Don't steal books.
